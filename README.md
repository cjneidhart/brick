# Brick

This is a WIP Story Format for Twine/Tweego. Currently, only Tweego is supported.

This format is intended to be a midpoint between [Snowman](https://videlais.github.io/snowman/) and [SugarCube](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/). Like Sugarcube, this format (will) come with a standard API for save management using local storage, and other high-quality features. But like Snowman, it will not attempt to make users learn a new Domain-Specific Language. Instead, its markup is intended to look very similar to JavaScript and HTML.
